# Inner Join - I

Getting data from a single table is boring. Let's join data from multiple tables together using the `INNER JOIN` syntax. Here's an example.
```sql
SELECT player_name, team_name FROM players INNER JOIN teams ON teams.id = players.team_id;
```
The result of this query is a list of all players (by player_name), along with the team for each player, based on the `team_id` column value for each player.

## Your Task

Retrieve the customer name, along with each order (by order ID) associated with the customer with ID equal 7.
